    abstract = {Methods for inference and interpretation of evolutionary quantitative genetic parameters, and for prediction of evolution in response to natural selection, are best developed for traits with normal distributions, yet many traits of evolutionary interest, such as most life history and behavioural traits, have inherently non-normal distributions. It is therefore becoming increasingly common to estimate quantitative genetic parameters, such as additive genetic variances, for non-normal traits using generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) analyses. These statistical methods provide inferences on a statistically-convenient latent scale, but not on the scale upon which traits are expressed. We provide a general approach for calculating quantitative genetic parameters on the observed scale for arbitrary GLMMs. Our approach requires no additional assumptions beyond those that made when adopting GLMM-based quantitative genetic analysis. We show that existing formulae for Binomial and Poisson distributions, in particular the threshold models for binary traits, are special cases in our framework. We use simulations to demonstrate the accuracy of our method for predicting the evolutionary response to selection and further illustrate our approach by applying it to data from a natural study population with pedigree information. Our framework is implemented in an R package, \textsc{QGglmm} (\url{https://github.com/devillemereuil/qgglmm}).},

    abstract = {An emerging infectious pathogen Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus has spread across much of Europe within recent years causing devastating damage on European common ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior) and associated plant communities. The present study demonstrates the presence of additive genetic variation in susceptibility of natural F. excelsior populations to the new invasive disease. We observe high levels of additive variation in the degree of susceptibility with relatively low influence of environmental factors (narrow-sense heritability = 0.37–0.52). Most native trees are found to be highly susceptible, and we estimate that only around 1\% has the potential of producing offspring with expected crown damage of <10\% under the present disease pressure. The results suggest that the presence of additive genetic diversity in natural F. excelsior populations can confer the species with important ability to recover, but that low resistance within natural European populations is to be expected because of a low frequency of the hypo-sensitive trees. Large effective population sizes will be required to avoid genetic bottlenecks. The role of artificial selection and breeding for protection of the species is discussed based on the findings.},

@article{Watanabe10,
    abstract = {In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2λ/n, where λ is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.},

@article{Nakagawa10,
    abstract = {Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the intra-class correlation coefficient, {ICC}) is an important index for quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for {non-Gaussian} data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and {non-Gaussian} data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance ({ANOVA})-based and linear mixed-effects model ({LMM})-based methods, while for {non-Gaussian} data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models ({GLMM}) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of {LMM}- and {GLMM}-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and {non-Gaussian} data.},

@article{Vazquez09,
    abstract = {Clinical mastitis is typically coded as presence/absence during some period of exposure, and records are analyzed with linear or binary data models. Because presence includes cows with multiple episodes, there is loss of information when a count is treated as a binary response. The Poisson model is designed for counting random variables, and although it is used extensively in epidemiology of mastitis, it has rarely been used for studying the genetics of mastitis. Many models have been proposed for genetic analysis of mastitis, but they have not been formally compared. The main goal of this study was to compare linear (Gaussian), Bernoulli (with logit link), and Poisson models for the purpose of genetic evaluation of sires for mastitis in dairy cattle. The response variables were clinical mastitis ({CM}; 0, 1) and number of {CM} cases ({NCM}; 0, 1, 2, …). Data consisted of records on 36,178 first-lactation daughters of 245 Norwegian Red sires distributed over 5,286 herds. Predictive ability of models was assessed via a 3-fold cross-validation using mean squared error of prediction ({MSEP}) as the end-point. Between-sire variance estimates for {NCM} were 0.065 in Poisson and 0.007 in the linear model. For {CM} the between-sire variance was 0.093 in logit and 0.003 in the linear model. The ratio between herd and sire variances for the models with {NCM} response was 4.6 and 3.5 for Poisson and linear, respectively, and for model for {CM} was 3.7 in both logit and linear models. The {MSEP} for all cows was similar. However, within healthy animals, {MSEP} was 0.085 (Poisson), 0.090 (linear for {NCM}), 0.053 (logit), and 0.056 (linear for {CM}). For mastitic animals the {MSEP} values were 1.206 (Poisson), 1.185 (linear for {NCM} response), 1.333 (logit), and 1.319 (linear for {CM} response). The models for count variables had a better performance when predicting diseased animals and also had a similar performance between them. Logit and linear models for {CM} had better predictive ability for healthy cows and had a similar performance between them.},

Data were generated from a pseudo-normal distribution to test this theory for estimates derived from parent-offspring correlation and paternal sib correlation.

    abstract = {Calculations of individual narrow-sense heritability and family mean heritability of a binary trait in stochastically simulated sib trials in completely randomized block experiments showed that in some situations estimates of  ” realized” heritabilities obtained from the mixed linear threshold model could be improved by application of a proposed beta-binomial model. The proposed model adopts the beta-binomial as the conjugate-prior for the distribution of probabilities of observing the binary trait in a genetic entry. Estimation of the beta parameters allows an estimation of selection response and, by linkage to a threshold model for the individual observations, the desired heritabilities can be obtained. The average bias in the betabinomial estimates of heritability and family mean heritability was less than 2\%. Improvements over existing procedures were especially manifest at heritabilities above 0.3 and at low overall probabilities of observing the trait (p < 0.30). The lowest root mean square errors were consistently obtained with the algorithm proposed by Harville and Mee (1984). The beta-binomial framework, although restricted to a single random additive genetic effect, further facilitates general analysis, estimation of selection response, and calculation of reliable family mean heritability. Intraclass correlations can be estimated directly from the beta-binomial parameters.},

The trial was established in 2005. Data of tree growth, ash dieback symptoms and collar rot prevalence were collected by surveying the trial in summer 2012 and compared with previously published data of the trial. Evaluations revealed a continuous and considerable increase in dieback severity since 2009. The results suggest that the infection process has not come to a standstill yet. Up to 2012, 6 \% of the trees remained symptomless, whereas mortality added up to 9 \%. There were significant differences in ash dieback severity between the investigated provenances. Collar rot prevalence ranged from 19 to 59 \% between study sites. Moreover, high spatial dependency of collar rot prevalence could be detected within sites. Collar rots were more abundant on trees of severe ash dieback intensity, but could also be detected on 15 \% of otherwise healthy trees. Mycelium from collar rots could be identified by means of {RFLP} analyses and sequencing of the {ITS} region as most likely belonging to Armillaria gallica. The possible roles of Armillaria spp. and H. pseudoalbidus in collar rot formation are discussed.},

    abstract = {Interval estimates ---estimates of parameters that include an allowance for sampling uncertainty--- have long been touted as a key component of statistical analyses. There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals ({CIs}): intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; the parameter values contained within a {CI} are thought to be more plausible than those outside the interval; and the
confidence coefficient of the interval (typically 95\%) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that {CIs} do not necessarily have any of these properties, and generally lead to incoherent inferences. For this reason, we recommend against the use of the method of {CIs} for inference.},

This approximation is valid only when the effective number of parameters in the model is much smaller than the number of independent observations. In disease mapping, a typical application of {DIC}, this assumption does not hold and {DIC} under-penalizes more complex models. Another deviance-based loss function, derived from the same decision-theoretic framework, is applied to mixture models, which have previously been considered an unsuitable application for {DIC}.},

The proposed model is useful for situations where the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented and discussed.},

    abstract = {The main aim of the present study was to estimate genetic variability and the level of genetic control of disease resistance in common ash populations based on progeny testing, and to select resistant populations, families and genotypes for production of reproductive material resistant to dieback caused by Chalara fraxinea. A total of 320 half-sib families from ten Lithuanian and fourteen foreign European Fraxinus excelsior populations have been tested in three progeny trials established in Tel\v{s}iai, Pakruojis, and K\.{e}dainiai State Forest Enterprises. Because of severe attacks by C. fraxinea, only 10\% of trees survived in all progeny trials at the age of eight years. Variance analysis of health condition scores revealed significant effect of genetic factors i.e., populations and families. Differences in resistance among populations were significant and ranged up to 52.8-55.1\% in a degree of damage and survival rate of populations varying from 0.13 to 0.59. At the age of eight years, genetic family variance components ranged 5.3-7.5\%, while the additive coefficients of genetic variation ranged 29.9-38.7\% indicating the existence of strong genetic differences in progenies' resistance to C. fraxinea both at population and family levels. There was a significant site effect on the level of damage which could be due to site conditions and/or different infection pressure from the surrounding stands. However, genotype by environment interaction (G x E) for resistance traits was weak and non-significant which indicated that populations and families do not differ much in their performance across environments and thus specific adaptations and genetic variation in ecological response are not pronounced. The obtained high heritability estimates (h²=0.40-0.49±0.03) for health condition indicated that resistance is genetically predetermined and inheritable, and allows forward selection and breeding of the resistant genotypes. Health condition of foreign populations was worse than that of the Lithuanian ones by 17.5-23.5\% in degree of damage and by 48.5-73.5\% in survival rate which could be a consequence of more advanced process of natural selection in resistance against C. fraxinea in damaged Lithuanian F. excelsior populations. The obtained results demonstrated that strategy of the extended introduction of foreign populations to restore Lithuanian ash stands is of doubtful potential. Only few most resistant foreign genotypes could be selected as potential candidates for breeding of 'synthetic' F. excelsior populations in order to increase genetic diversity. Among the Lithuanian populations, the best in terms of growth characteristics, resistance, survival, and proportion of most healthy individuals were those originating from Ignalina, Pakruojis, \v{S}akiai and K\.{e}dainiai. Based on estimated {BLUP} breeding values, complex breeding indexes and on so-called 'Pyramid selection principle', fifty superior individuals were selected within best families from the best populations for establishing resistant breeding populations of common ash in different provenance regions of Lithuania, as well as for establishing clonal trials and resistant seed orchards of second generation.},

    abstract = {{Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits brings together the diverse array of theoretical and empirical applications of quantitative genetics under one cover, in a way that is both comprehensive and accessible to anyone with a rudimentary understanding of statistics and genetics. What was originally envisioned as a single text has now become two, with the focus of this first book being on the basic biology and methods of analysis of quantitative characters. (The second book, Evolution and Selection of Quantitative Traits, will address the basic principles that govern the evolutionary dynamics of quantitative characters under the forces of mutation, random genetic drift, and natural and/or artificial selection, integrating the theory of evolution of such characters with existing empirical data from natural and domesticated plant and animal populations.) Written as a general text in quantitative genetics, the book will also be useful as a basic reference for the seasoned professional. Throughout, central theoretical concepts are developed from first principles. To aid the less statistically sophisticated reader, several chapters and appendices focus on the basic statistical tools needed to digest the book. Wherever possible, theoretical and analytical concepts are illustrated with empirical examples from diverse settings.  <P>Three major features of Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits distinguish it from earlier work. First, it reflects the explosive influx over the past few years of quantitative-genetic thinking into evolutionary biology. Second, in animal breeding, enormous strides have been made in the development of new techniques for estimating breeding values (for the purposes of identifying elite individuals in selection programs) and for estimating variance components from samples of complex pedigrees. In this text's last two chapters, the authors outline the basic principles of complex pedigree analysis, without getting bogged down in technical details. Third, Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits provides a broad overview of the newly emerging array of techniques for quantitative-trait loci (QTL) analysis, currently one of the most active fields of quantitative-genetic research.  <P>Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits contains numerous fully-worked examples and illustrations of theoretical concepts, as well as over 2,000 references with indices by subject, author, and organism. In addition, the authors maintain a World Wide Web site featuring up-to-date lists of computer programs and on-line resources, and added information on various topics presented in the text.}},

@article{Spiegelhalter02,
    abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure {pD} for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general {pD} approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding {pD} to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

Forsuch models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications,the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine {analysis.We} show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simpliﬁed version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main beneﬁt of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},
